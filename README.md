avrtest
=======

This is a basic skeleton for AVR projects using avr-gcc, avrdude, etc.

Out of the box it supports writing the program an AVR via the Arduino bootloader (`make burn`), or an AVRISP mkII (`make burn2`.)
It also supports generating a brief report of your flash & SRAM usage (`make report`).
